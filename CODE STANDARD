#CODE STANDARD#
#READ BEFORE CODING! PLEASE FOLLOW THE RULES BELOW#

1. Write appropriate comments to your code, for example:
a If you need to mark something to do, write //TODO, or give it a time stamp like //TODO 04/01/14
b If you want someone to review your code snippet, write //NEED REVIEW
c If you think your code is unsafe but hasn't found any bugs, mention it in comments like // UNSAFE
d Write more comments to your function to demonstrate what it does if the function body is long and complex.
  You need to demonstrate what the parameters are for and the return value is what.


2. Name standard:
a For member variables: name it like: _var
b For global static variables: name it like: g_var
c For global constant variables: name it like: VAR
d For others, name it using the usual way and don't use underscore, for example:
  class: FileServer
  function: recursiveRead
  variable: treeMap

3. MISCELLANEOUS
a Don't commit if the code is not functional.
b If others' code doesn't make sense, just ask!
c Don't put all of the code into one class, refactor the structure frequently and define more classes to make it more clear.
d Use assertions to help you debug
