1. Client Design:
In client side, there are two hash tables. One records all of the file in the Dropbox Directory in the last synchroization, the other keeps the file in the current synchroization.
For every synchronization, client compares these two hash tables to get the file to be deleted, added and updated. For deleted file operation, client only needs to send the relative file path, and then server will delete it. For newly created/updated file, client will send the file path and the content to the server.

The communication protocol is like this:
fileNumber (4 bytes) -- the header of this protocol, tell the server how many file needed to be synchronized
file Operation(1 byte) -- delete, create or update, if the operation is create or update, the rest part of protocol is like this:
the length of file path(4 bytes) -- tell the server how many bytes to be read in the stream to get the file path
file path
file last modified time (8 bytes)
isDir  (1 byte) tell the server the file is directory or file
file size (8 bytes) tell the server how many bytes to be read in the stream to get the file content
file content

if the operation is deleted, the rest part of protocol is like this:
the length of file path(4 bytes) -- tell the server how many bytes to be read in the stream to get the file path
file path


so for example, if one file called "deleteme" is deleted, one file called "createme.cpp" is created, and one file called "updateme.cpp" is modified, the protocol is:

fileNumber: 3  	-- how many file needed to be synchronized
DELETE(1 byte)  -- delete, create or update
8               -- the length of file path
deleteme        -- file name
CREATE(1 byte)  -- delete, create or update
13              -- the length of file path
createme.cpp     -- file name
12:30, 2011/1/1/ -- last modified time
FALSE            -- is Dir?
10               -- file size
123456           -- the content of the file
UPDATE(1 byte)  -- delete, create or update
13              -- the length of file path
updateme.cpp     -- file name
12:30, 2012/1/1/ -- last modified time
FALSE            -- is Dir?
10               -- file size
123456           -- the content of the file


2. Server Design:
Server keep listening to the client, and once receives the input stream, it deserilize the stream and do the corresponding thing.
